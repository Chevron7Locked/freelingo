# README Guidelines

## Purpose

The README is the public entry point for users, self-hosters, and contributors. It should explain what
FreeLingo is, how to start it, and where to find detailed documentation. It is not a release ledger,
implementation inventory, or exhaustive operations manual.

## Structure

Keep these sections in this order:

1. **Title, badges, and logo** — project identity and current version/runtime badges.
2. **Overview** — deployment modes, core learning flow, and major user-facing capabilities.
3. **Hosted service** — link to `freelingo.app` and distinction from AGPL self-hosting.
4. **For businesses** — deployment and commercial-licence options.
5. **Architecture** — brief system boundary with links to authoritative specs.
6. **Repository** — top-level directory tree.
7. **Stack** — concise layer-to-technology list.
8. **Quick start** — Docker Compose and Portainer paths.
9. **Operational notes** — essential provider, quota, and target-language facts.
10. **Host requirements** — Redis memory overcommit and production reverse proxy.
11. **TTS and STT** — provider selection and links to speech and Docker specs.
12. **Development, contributing, licence, and author** — project links and ownership.

## Content rules

- Keep language factual and concise.
- Keep the architecture summary short and delegate structure to `architecture.instructions.md`.
- List only top-level directories and relevant root files in the repository tree.
- Link to `https://freelingo.app` for the hosted service and to `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` for commercial
  licensing.
- Cover both CLI and Portainer deployment in Quick start.
- Keep required deployment variables and host prerequisites explicit.
- Delegate CI, dependency installation, provider contracts, model matrices, voice catalogs, and full
  environment-variable reference to their dedicated files and specs.
- Do not add phase/completion matrices, test counts, release history, or session-specific status.
- Do not add a separate Features section; the overview owns concise feature coverage.
- Avoid Markdown tables; use short lists that remain readable on narrow screens.

## When to update

Update the README for:

- user-facing capabilities that materially change the overview;
- supported technology or deployment changes;
- new top-level directories or relevant root files;
- version badges;
- commercial, licensing, hosted-service, or operational requirement changes;
- development or contribution entry-point changes.

Do not update it for internal refactors, files added inside existing modules, tests, implementation
counts, or spec content changes that do not affect public navigation.
